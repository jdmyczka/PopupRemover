# PopupRemover
This is a popup remover that removes any flex-based element on a website. This means that anything that stays in position when you scroll down is deleted/disabled. 

It has been tested on many annoying websites and functionally removes any ads or prompts that are asking to steal your data and cookies without deleting the main content. 

It deletes the scroll bar which is then solved by implementing a new one. In addition, it removes the page dim that occurs when a pop-up prompt asks for your email.
